# Omni Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone is building a roof ontop of my project. This will make my robot really sturdy, hide my wires and overall make my project look cooler. I was able to use 3 short pillars from another project and place the roof ontop. The project however stops my ability to know which way is straight so I will put a cool design ontop so I know which way my Omni-bot is facing.



# Second Milestone

My Second Milestone in the Omni Robot Project was controlling 3 motors together to move in any direction using a wireless playstation 2 controller. To acheive this goal I was able to map my analog joysticks on my controller and calculate how much speed and direction each wheel should move. This way my Robot can now move in any direction and rotate left and right with the right joystick. I enjoyed organising all the different components onto the board and making it look clean enough. I struggled a lot with the code but with the help of my instructors and fellow students I was able to complete the code after lots of debugging and trouble. I learned a lot about how fumctions and calculation can be used in my project.

# First Milestone

My first milestone in the Onmi Robot project was controlling a motor using a wireless playstation 2 controller. To acheive this goal I used a wireless receiver and connected it to my ardiuno, this way I was able to send signals from my playstation controller to my arduino. By usign a library online the arduino can understand the signals from the receiver, and turn it into commands the arduino can send to my motor controller which then moves the motor in the direction I want. I enjoyed wiring different components of my build together as sending power, and signals was very straight forward. I struggled a lot with using the library online as it was over 12 years old and very inconsistant. I also struggled working with the playstation 2 controller because it took several restarts of the arduino to sync up. I learned a lot about coding an arduino as I have never used an arduino in a project before.

# Starter Project
My starter project is the Useless Machine and its purpose is to turn it self off everytime I flick the switch. It works with a on/off switch connected to a motorized arm via PCB board. What I enjoyed about this project is soldering different components onto a PCB board. What I struggled with on this project, is that wires started breaking out of the motor due to the compactness of the build. But I overcame this problem by deconstructing the build and soldering the wires back in place on the motor. As this was my first major project with the parts involved I learned principal information about sautering different motors, snap switches, wire terminals, resistors and how they connect onto circuit board in a way to create a project with purpose.
